* Playing around with the bottom of the page, rendering a higher quality image and overlaying not its entirety but majority with a slightly blurred box - I have asked Lera to make a high resolution drawing
* Playing around with the different side bars that Lera has designed to work out which looks best
* Could we please make the lamp and apple bigger and on the end of the completed part of the progress bar? So that in the final stage it is shining on the submit button?
* Syncing the new design of the fundraising widgets (Lera should update them with regards to the numbers as discussed yesterday)
